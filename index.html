      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a
        newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19
        virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover
        without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with
        underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
        chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop
        serious illness. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is
        to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and
        how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing
        your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching
        your face. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of
        saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or
        sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette
        (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
